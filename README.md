Description:
This project involves the analysis of presidential polling data from 2020. The data is loaded from an Excel file, "presidential_polls_2020.xlsx", using the readxl package in R. The data from two sheets, "Sheet1" and "Sheet2", are combined into one data frame named combined_President_data. Missing data rows are removed using the na.omit() function, resulting in a cleaned dataset named cleaned_president_data. Further data cleaning is performed, including updating the year format and standardizing state and candidate names. The cleaned data is saved to an Excel file named "cleaned_president_data06.xlsx". Finally, visualizations are generated to analyze the distribution of sample sizes across states and to compare sample sizes by pollster. These visualizations aid in understanding the polling data and identifying trends and patterns related to sample sizes in different regions and among different polling organizations during the 2020 presidential elections.
